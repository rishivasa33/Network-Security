***

## Name
A5 - Program for RSA Algorithm Emulation

## Installation
1) Install Java version 17 or higher
2) Clone the repository to a local folder
3) Run: javac <RSAAlgorithm.java>
4) Run: java <RSAAlgorithm>

## Usage
1) Enter the values of p and q which are prime numbers
2) Run the program and check output

3) NOTE: This program has been built without being concerned about time or space complexity. BigInteger has been used throughout instead of primitive datatypes, as I was unsure about the edge cases of the input values.
